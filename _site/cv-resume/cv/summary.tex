\begin{cvparagraph}
{I have more than 10 years of professional experience, mostly in support and 
systems administration positions, but also did a little bit of software development,
primarily for automation.

Worked as the IT Infrastructure Coordinator at Dafiti Group, managing a team of 
10 people responsible for keeping the systems for 3 e-commerces, that together, 
are listed in the top 15 e-commerce in Brazil as reported by Retail and Consume 
Brazilian Society (SBVC).

Today, I'm working as IT Infrastructure Manager at Stoodi, where I'm responsible
for the whole platform's cloud infrastructure, maintaining the website uptime,
CI/CD pipelines, tests environments, etc.

Since early age I developed an interest for technology, starting to study C and 
Java with 12 years old, and maintaining Linux machines for study and personal 
use since 15 years old.}
